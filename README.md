## Features

This chat website allows users to chat with a chatbot powered by the ChatGPT API. The website has a simple and user-friendly interface designed with Tailwind CSS. The chatbot uses natural language processing to understand and respond to user queries.

The chatbot's functionality is built using Next.js, a popular React-based framework for building server-side rendered web applications. The project also uses Prisma, an ORM for database access, to store chat messages and other data.
